title: About Me
---

I am Pujan Mehta, a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at D. J. Sanghvi College of Engineering. I have fluency in programming languages like Python, Java, and C. I am also a full-stack Web developer.

Most of the projects that I have worked on until now are based on Python and I also started my programming career in 2016 with Python with which I realized the true power of Python and also found that many of the big organizations around the world use it heavily. Having knowledge in Software Development helped me get an internship at a Silicon-Valley based startup named Falkonry where I used Python, Java, Node.js, and Git and learned Docker, Kubernetes, and ELK Stack and also got to work on AWS.
Recently, I also completed MOOCs on Machine Learning and Deep Learning during which I used tools like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and PyTorch and also got an internship at VoyaGenius Labs. My background knowledge comprises of Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Machine Learning.

And apart from these, I am also a student mentor at DJ Unicode a college level open-source organization where I guide juniors on their back-end development projects and I also like Competitive Programming and I take part in competitions held on Codechef and HackerRank.

Regarding further details like things about my work, projects, etc. you can find it in my Resume.
